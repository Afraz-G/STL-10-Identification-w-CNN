# STL-10-Identification-w-CNN
A CNN built upon numpy that classifies an STL-10 dataset from http://cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10 (created by Adam Coates, Honglak Lee, Andrew Y. Ng).
Dataset includes 10 classes (airplane, bird, car, cat, deer, dog, horse, monkey, ship, truck) with each image being 96 by 96 pixels in color, consisting in pure binary data. 
Utilizes a maxpool of size 2, a Conv filter of size 3, and a softmax prediction process. 
This is a personal learning project and there may be instances of inefficiency and oversight and I will be trying my best to adjust and improve as well as apply this model for later projects if possible.
